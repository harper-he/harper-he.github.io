      I'm currently a Insights Analyst at 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.meetyogi.com/" target="_blank">Yogi</a> 
      leading analytics efforts to leverage data and BI tools (Tableau) to produce actionable insights and create compelling presentations to drive value for CPG clients. I graduated from
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.syracuse.edu/" target="_blank">Syracuse University</a> with a 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://whitman.syr.edu/programs-and-academics/programs/ms/Business-Analytics/curriculum.aspx" target="_blank">M.S. in Business Analytics</a>
      (<a class="underline-link" href="https://harper-he.github.io/transcripts.pdf" target="_blank">GPA:3.97/4.0</a>) in 2020.
      Before that, I received a BA in New Media at the 
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://en.cuc.edu.cn/2135/list.htm" target="_blank">Communication University of China</a>.

      Some of the technologies that I love working on are 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://github.com/harper-he/Python/" target="_blank">Python</a>, 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://github.com/harper-he/Python/tree/master/Big%20Data%20Analytics" target="_blank">Spark</a>, 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://github.com/harper-he/SQL" target="_blank">SQL</a>, 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://github.com/harper-he/R" target="_blank">R</a>, 
      Tableau, Looker and PowerBI.
      I like to understand and explore numbers and translate the data to provide valuable stories.

      I am looking to mobilize the skills that I have gained in data analysis, marketing and communication, 
      and creative problem solving in my current position at Yogi, 
      an analytics platform powered by deep machine learning architecture, Natural Language Processing algorithms, and cutting-edge visualizations, in a new role that allows me to thrive as an Insight Analyst.
      More recently, I generated and presented insights using data analysis tools and techniques including codes/scripts, statistical analysis, and BI tools for top CPG companies.
