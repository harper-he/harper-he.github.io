Data Enthusiast! | Data Geek! | Data Engineer | Big Data

I have spent more than a decade working on various Big Data, Data Warehousing, Business Intelligence/Data Visualization projects at various enterprise companies.

Some of the technologies that I love working on are SQL, Hadoop, Hive, Sqoop, Spark, Kafka, Python, Tableau, and PowerBI. Basically, everything DATA!!! 
I believe in the saying that, thereâ€™s always room for improvement and have the zest to keep learning everything thatâ€™s data! As much as Iâ€™m into data integration, preparation, and manipulation, itâ€™s the analysis of data that really gets me going. I like to understand and explore the relationships between entities and numbers and translate the data to provide valuable stories.

Here is a link to my Resume. Also, you can get in touch with me through the social platforms or through the Contact page.

Below are a few projects that I have worked on and those that you may find useful. Please drop in a comment, feedback or like and share the post.

Iâ€™m Alli (ðŸ‘‹) and Iâ€™m a user researcher and conversion copywriter who helps SaaS marketing teams understand and address revenue-related problems. I get you the qualitative data you need to understand *why* things are happening and *who* you should build things for. Then I write the copy for you to test.
Iâ€™ve been writing for web-based businesses since 2010 and SaaS businesses in particular since 2014. Since joining this tiny corner of the professional world, Iâ€™ve had incredible opportunities to do some interesting work, in large part due to the community of generous people working in SaaS.
Kind words past clients have said about me:

https://marijanakay.com/
Iâ€™m a freelance writer and content strategist for awesome brands in the SaaS and marketing field, translating their story and expertise into content that brings qualified traffic, valuable leads, and a loyal community.

I started out in journalism, turned to course development for a digital marketing certification company, and finally converted into the business-focused writer I am today.

I became obsessed with marketing in 2015, started learning about it, practicing it, and never stopped. Now, I develop unique content for companies equally obsessed with it from my Dublin home office.

Thereâ€™s nothing else Iâ€™d rather be doing.
